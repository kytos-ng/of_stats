In order to manage a network, an administrator must have updated and reliable
statistics about it, in several levels of deepness, from a
switch port inbound and outbound traffic to the traffic of different connected
networks.

To achieve that, this Network Application collects statistical data provided by
the switches connected to the controller. We *do not use SNMP protocol* because
the OpenFlow protocol already provide this data. The data is stored using the 
Network Application Kronos. All the stored data can be accessed using Kronos
NApp.

The provided statistics, per switch, are:

* **Ports/Interfaces**: bytes/sec, utilization, dropped packets/sec and
  errors/sec split into transmission and reception; interface name, MAC address
  and link speed (Bps);
* **Flows**: packets/sec, bytes/sec;

##########
Installing
##########

To install this NApp, first, make sure to have the same venv activated as you have ``kytos`` installed on:

.. code:: shell

   $ git clone https://github.com/kytos-ng/of_stats.git
   $ cd flow_manager
   $ python3 setup.py develop

###########
Configuring
###########
There's no need to configure anything for this NApp to run. Read the sections
below if you need to change of_stats behavior or just want to know more details
on how it works.

*************
Settings file
*************
You can customize settings like how long to wait before asking the switches
for more statistics in the file ``settings.py``.

****************
Custom bandwidth
****************
Sometimes, the link speed is wrongly reported by the switch or there's no such
speed in the protocol specification. In these cases, you can manually define
the speeds in the file ``user_speed.json``. Changes to this file will be loaded
automatically without the need to restart the controller.

Setting interface speeds manually is quite easy. Just create
``user_speed.json`` by copying and customizing the provided
``user_speed.example.json`` file. Let's see what the provided example means:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "default": 12500000000,
     "00:00:00:00:00:00:00:01":
     {
       "default": 1250000000,
       "4": 125000000
     }
   }

Keep in mind that, for consistency reasons, we try to keep the units in bytes
whenever possible. Thus, speeds should specified in bytes/sec (not necessarily
integers).

Any value in this file overrides the OpenFlow values returned by the switches.
In this file, inner values take precedence over outer ones.

The *default* values are optional. The first line has a default value that
specifies the speed of any interface that is not found in this file
(12,500,000,000 Bps = 100 Gbps). Then, there's a default value set for all
interfaces of the switch whose dpid is *00:...:00:01* (1,250,000,000 Bps = 10
Gbps). Even more specifically, its interface with port number 4 is 125,000,000
Bps (1 Gbps).

To make it even more clear, find below the speed of several interfaces when
``user_speed.json`` has the content above:

+-------------------------+------+--------------+
|          DPID 1         | Port | Speed (Gbps) |
+=========================+======+==============+
| 00:00:00:00:00:00:00:01 |  4   |        1     |
+-------------------------+------+--------------+
| 00:00:00:00:00:00:00:01 |  2   |       10     |
+-------------------------+------+--------------+
| 00:00:00:00:00:00:00:02 |  4   |      100     |
+-------------------------+------+--------------+
| 00:00:00:00:00:00:00:02 |  2   |      100     |
+-------------------------+------+--------------+

Rest API

You can find a list of the available endpoints and example input/output in the
'REST API' tab in this NApp's webpage in the `Kytos NApps Server
<https://napps.kytos.io/kytos/of_stats>`_.

Troubleshooting

.. attention:: The filenames below are relative to this NApp's folder.
   If you run Kytos as root, it is ``/var/lib/kytos/napps/kytos/of_stats`` or,
   if using virtualenv, ``$VIRTUAL_ENV/var/lib/kytos/napps/kytos/of_stats``.

**********************
Wrong link utilization
**********************
Check whether the link bandwidth is correct. If it is not, set the correct
bandwidth by following the instructions in *Configuring*, *Custom bandwidth*.

****************************
New settings are not applied
****************************
Some changes in ``settings.py`` require recreating the database. Check the
section ``Deleting the database`` below.
